<p>As a so&shy;ciety de&shy;pends more on en&shy;ergy sources for its daily func&shy;tioning, it be&shy;comes more vul&shy;ner&shy;able if the supply of en&shy;ergy is in&shy;ter&shy;rupted. This ob&shy;vious fact is ig&shy;nored in cur&shy;rent strate&shy;gies to achieve en&shy;ergy se&shy;cu&shy;rity, making them counter-pro&shy;duc&shy;tive.<sup id="fnref1:LTM"><a href="#fn:LTM" class="footnote-ref" aria-label="Jump to Footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>What does it mean for a so&shy;ciety<sup id="fnref1:LTM_coppice"><a href="#fn:LTM_coppice" class="footnote-ref" aria-label="Jump to Footnote">2</a></sup> to have “en&shy;ergy se&shy;cu&shy;rity”? Al&shy;though there are more than forty dif&shy;ferent def&shy;ini&shy;tions of the con&shy;cept, they all share the fun&shy;da&shy;mental cri&shy;terium that en&shy;ergy supply should al&shy;ways meet en&shy;ergy de&shy;mand. This also im&shy;plies that en&shy;ergy supply needs to be con&shy;stant – there can be no in&shy;ter&shy;rup&shy;tions in the ser&shy;vice. For ex&shy;ample, the In&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tional En&shy;ergy Agency (IEA) de&shy;fines en&shy;ergy se&shy;cu&shy;rity as “the un&shy;in&shy;ter&shy;rupted avail&shy;ability of en&shy;ergy sources at an af&shy;ford&shy;able price”, the US De&shy;part&shy;ment of En&shy;ergy and Cli&shy;mate Change (DECC) de&shy;fines the con&shy;cept as meaning that “the risks of in&shy;ter&shy;rup&shy;tion to en&shy;ergy supply are low”, and the EU de&shy;fines it as a “stable and abun&shy;dant supply of en&shy;ergy”.</p>
<p>His&shy;tor&shy;ically, en&shy;ergy se&shy;cu&shy;rity was achieved by se&shy;curing ac&shy;cess to forests or peat bogs for thermal en&shy;ergy, and to human, an&shy;imal, wind or water power sources for me&shy;chan&shy;ical en&shy;ergy. With the ar&shy;rival of the In&shy;dus&shy;trial Rev&shy;olu&shy;tion, en&shy;ergy se&shy;cu&shy;rity came to de&shy;pend on the supply of fossil fuels. As a the&shy;oret&shy;ical con&shy;cept, en&shy;ergy se&shy;cu&shy;rity is most closely re&shy;lated to the oil crises from the 1970s, when em&shy;bar&shy;goes and price ma&shy;nip&shy;ula&shy;tions lim&shy;ited oil supply to Western na&shy;tions. As a re&shy;sult, most in&shy;dus&shy;tri&shy;alised so&shy;ci&shy;eties still stock&shy;pile oil re&shy;serves that are equiv&shy;alent to sev&shy;eral months of con&shy;sump&shy;tion.</p>
<p>Al&shy;though oil re&shy;mains as vital to in&shy;dus&shy;trial economies as it was in the 1970s, mainly for trans&shy;porta&shy;tion and agri&shy;cul&shy;ture, it’s now recog&shy;nised that en&shy;ergy se&shy;cu&shy;rity in modern so&shy;ci&shy;eties also de&shy;pends on other in&shy;fras&shy;truc&shy;tures, such as those sup&shy;plying gas, elec&shy;tricity, and even data. Fur&shy;ther&shy;more, these in&shy;fras&shy;truc&shy;tures in&shy;creas&shy;ingly in&shy;ter&shy;con&shy;nect and de&shy;pend on each other. For ex&shy;ample, gas is an im&shy;por&shy;tant fuel for power pro&shy;duc&shy;tion, while the power grid is now re&shy;quired to op&shy;erate gas pipelines. Power grids are needed to run data net&shy;works, and data net&shy;works are now needed to run power grids.</p>
