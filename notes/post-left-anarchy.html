		<article role="main"><h1 id="Post-Left+Anarchism">Post-Left An&shy;ar&shy;chism</h1>
<p>From the mo&shy;ment when he catches sight of the light of the world a man seeks to find out him&shy;self and get hold of him&shy;self out of its con&shy;fu&shy;sion, in which he, with ev&shy;ery&shy;thing else, is tossed about in mot&shy;ley mix&shy;ture.<sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>But ev&shy;ery&shy;thing that comes in con&shy;tact with the child de&shy;fends it&shy;self in turn against his at&shy;tacks, and as&shy;serts its own per&shy;sis&shy;tence.</p>
<p>Ac&shy;cord&shy;ingly, be&shy;cause each thing cares for it&shy;self at the same time comes into con&shy;stant col&shy;li&shy;sion with other things, the com&shy;bat of self-as&shy;ser&shy;tion is un&shy;avoid&shy;able.</p>
<p>Vic&shy;tory or de&shy;feat — be&shy;tween the two al&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tives the fate of the com&shy;bat wa&shy;vers. The vic&shy;tor be&shy;comes the lord, the van&shy;quished one the sub&shy;ject: the for&shy;mer ex&shy;er&shy;cises supremacy and “rights of supremacy,” the lat&shy;ter ful&shy;fills in awe and def&shy;er&shy;ence the “du&shy;ties of a sub&shy;ject.</p>
<p>But both re&shy;main en&shy;emies, and al&shy;ways lie in wait: they watch for each other’s weak&shy;nesses — chil&shy;dren for those of their par&shy;ents and par&shy;ents for those of their chil&shy;dren (e.g., their fear); ei&shy;ther the stick con&shy;quers the man, or the man con&shy;quers the stick.</p>
<p>In child&shy;hood lib&shy;er&shy;ation takes the di&shy;rec&shy;tion of try&shy;ing to get to the bot&shy;tom of things, to get at what is “back of” things; there&shy;fore we spy out the weak points of ev&shy;ery&shy;body, for which, it is well known, chil&shy;dren have a sure in&shy;stinct; there&shy;fore we like to smash things, like to rum&shy;mage through hid&shy;den cor&shy;ners, pry af&shy;ter what is cov&shy;ered up or out of the way, and try what we can do with ev&shy;ery&shy;thing. When we once get at what is back of the things, we know we are safe; when, e.g., we have got at the fact that the rod is too weak against our ob&shy;du&shy;racy, then we no longer fear it, “have out-grown it.”</p>
<p>Back of the rod, might&shy;ier than it, stands our — ob&shy;du&shy;racy, our ob&shy;du&shy;rate courage. By de&shy;grees we get at what is back of ev&shy;ery&shy;thing that was mys&shy;te&shy;ri&shy;ous and un&shy;canny to us, the mys&shy;te&shy;ri&shy;ously-dreaded might of the rod, the fa&shy;ther’s stern look, etc., and back of all we find our ataraxia, i. e. im&shy;per&shy;turba&shy;bil&shy;ity, in&shy;tre&shy;pid&shy;ity, our coun&shy;ter force, our odds of strength, our in&shy;vin&shy;ci&shy;bil&shy;ity. Be&shy;fore that which for&shy;merly in&shy;spired in us fear and def&shy;er&shy;ence we no longer re&shy;treat shyly, but take courage. Back of ev&shy;ery&shy;thing we find our courage, our su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or&shy;ity; back of the sharp com&shy;mand of par&shy;ents and au&shy;thor&shy;ities stands, af&shy;ter all, our coura&shy;geous choice or our out&shy;wit&shy;ting shrewd&shy;ness. And the more we feel our&shy;selves, the smaller ap&shy;pears that which be&shy;fore seemed in&shy;vin&shy;ci&shy;ble. And what is our trick&shy;ery, shrewd&shy;ness, courage, ob&shy;du&shy;racy? What else but — mind![Geist. This word will be trans&shy;lated some&shy;times “mind” and some&shy;times “spirit” in the fol&shy;low&shy;ing pages]</p>
<p>Through a con&shy;sid&shy;er&shy;able time we are spared a fight that is so ex&shy;haust&shy;ing later — the fight against rea&shy;son. The fairest part of child&shy;hood passes with&shy;out the ne&shy;ces&shy;sity of com&shy;ing to blows with rea&shy;son. We care noth&shy;ing at all about it, do not med&shy;dle with it, ad&shy;mit no rea&shy;son. We are not to be per&shy;suaded to any&shy;thing by con&shy;vic&shy;tion, and are deaf to good ar&shy;gu&shy;ments, prin&shy;ci&shy;ples, etc.; on the other hand, coax&shy;ing, pun&shy;ish&shy;ment, etc. are hard for us to re&shy;sist.</p>
<p>This stern life-and-death com&shy;bat with rea&shy;son en&shy;ters later, and be&shy;gins a new phase; in child&shy;hood we scam&shy;per about with&shy;out rack&shy;ing our brains much.</p>
<p>Mind is the name of the first self-dis&shy;cov&shy;ery, the first self-dis&shy;cov&shy;ery, the first un&shy;de&shy;ifi&shy;ca&shy;tion of the di&shy;vine; i. e., of the un&shy;canny, the spooks, the “pow&shy;ers above.” Our fresh feel&shy;ing of youth, this feel&shy;ing of self, now de&shy;fers to noth&shy;ing; the world is dis&shy;cred&shy;ited, for we are above it, we are mind.</p>
<p>Now for the first time we see that hith&shy;erto we have not looked at the world in&shy;tel&shy;li&shy;gently at all, but only stared at it.</p>
<p>We ex&shy;er&shy;cise the be&shy;gin&shy;nings of our strength on nat&shy;ural pow&shy;ers. We de&shy;fer to par&shy;ents as a nat&shy;ural power; later we say: Fa&shy;ther and mother are to be for&shy;saken, all nat&shy;ural power to be counted as riven. They are van&shy;quished. For the ra&shy;tio&shy;nal, i.e. the “in&shy;tel&shy;lec&shy;tual” man, there is no fam&shy;ily as a nat&shy;ural power; a re&shy;nun&shy;ci&shy;ation of par&shy;ents, broth&shy;ers, etc., makes its ap&shy;pear&shy;ance. If these are “born again” as in&shy;tel&shy;lec&shy;tual, ra&shy;tio&shy;nal pow&shy;ers, they are no longer at all what they were be&shy;fore.</p>
<p>And not only par&shy;ents, but men in gen&shy;eral, are con&shy;quered by the young man; they are no hin&shy;drance to him, and are no longer re&shy;garded; for now he says: One must obey God rather than men.</p>
<p>From this high stand&shy;point ev&shy;ery&shy;thing “earthly” re&shy;cedes into con&shy;temptible re&shy;mote&shy;ness; for the stand&shy;point is — the heav&shy;enly.</p>
<p>The at&shy;ti&shy;tude is now al&shy;to&shy;gether re&shy;versed; the youth takes up an in&shy;tel&shy;lec&shy;tual po&shy;si&shy;tion, while the boy, who did not yet feel him&shy;self as mind, grew up on mind&shy;less learn&shy;ing. The for&shy;mer does not try to get hold of things (e.g. to get into his head the data of his&shy;tory), but of the thoughts that lie hid&shy;den in things, and so, e.g., of the spirit of his&shy;tory. On the other hand, the boy un&shy;der&shy;stands con&shy;nec&shy;tions no doubt, but not ideas, the spirit; there&shy;fore he strings to&shy;gether what&shy;ever can be learned, with&shy;out pro&shy;ceed&shy;ing a pri&shy;ori and the&shy;oret&shy;ically, i.e. with&shy;out look&shy;ing for ideas.</p>
<p>As in child&shy;hood one had to over&shy;come the re&shy;sis&shy;tance of the laws of the world, so now in ev&shy;ery&shy;thing that he pro&shy;poses he is met by an ob&shy;jec&shy;tion of the mind, of rea&shy;son, of his own con&shy;science. “That is un&shy;rea&shy;son&shy;able, unchris&shy;tian, un&shy;pa&shy;tri&shy;otic,” etc., cries con&shy;science to us, and — fright&shy;ens us away from it. Not the might of the aveng&shy;ing Eu&shy;menides, not Po&shy;sei&shy;don’s wrath, not God, far as he sees the hid&shy;den, not the fa&shy;ther’s rod of pun&shy;ish&shy;ment, do we fear, but — con&shy;science.</p>
<p>We “run af&shy;ter our thoughts” now, and fol&shy;low their com&shy;mands just as be&shy;fore we fol&shy;lowed parental, hu&shy;man ones. Our course of ac&shy;tion is de&shy;ter&shy;mined by our thoughts (ideas, con&shy;cep&shy;tions, faith) as it is in child&shy;hood by the com&shy;mands of our par&shy;ents.</p>
<p>For all that, we were al&shy;ready think&shy;ing when we were chil&shy;dren, only our thoughts were not flesh&shy;less, ab&shy;stract, ab&shy;so&shy;lute, i. e., NOTH&shy;ING BUT THOUGHTS, a heaven in them&shy;selves, a pure world of thought, log&shy;ical thoughts.</p>
<p>On the con&shy;trary, they had been only thoughts that we had about a thing; we thought of the thing so or so. Thus we may have thought “God made the world that we see there,” but we did not think of (“search”) the “depths of the God&shy;head it&shy;self”; we may have thought “that is the truth about the mat&shy;ter,” but we do not think of Truth it&shy;self, nor unite into one sen&shy;tence “God is truth.” The “depths of the God&shy;head, who is truth,” we did not touch. Over such purely log&shy;ical, i.e. the&shy;olog&shy;ical ques&shy;tions, “What is truth?” Pi&shy;late does not stop, though he does not there&shy;fore hes&shy;itate to as&shy;cer&shy;tain in an in&shy;di&shy;vid&shy;ual case “what truth there is in the thing,” i.e. whether the thing is true.</p>
<p>Any thought bound to a thing is not yet noth&shy;ing but a thought, ab&shy;so&shy;lute thought.</p>
<p>To bring to light the pure thought, or to be of its party, is the de&shy;light of youth; and all the shapes of light in the world of thought, like truth, free&shy;dom, hu&shy;man&shy;ity, Man, etc., il&shy;lu&shy;mine and in&shy;spire the youth&shy;ful soul.</p>
<p>But, when the spirit is rec&shy;og&shy;nized as the es&shy;sen&shy;tial thing, it still makes a dif&shy;fer&shy;ence whether the spirit is poor or rich, and there&shy;fore one seeks to be&shy;come rich in spirit; the spirit wants to spread out so as to found its em&shy;pire — an em&shy;pire that is not of this world, the world just con&shy;quered. Thus, then, it longs to be&shy;come all in all to it&shy;self; i.e., al&shy;though I am spirit, I am not yet per&shy;fected spirit, and must first seek the com&shy;plete spirit.</p>
<p>But with that I, who had just now found my&shy;self as spirit, lose my&shy;self again at once, bow&shy;ing be&shy;fore the com&shy;plete spirit as one not my own but su&shy;per&shy;nal, and feel&shy;ing my empti&shy;ness.</p>
<p>Spirit is the es&shy;sen&shy;tial point for ev&shy;ery&shy;thing, to be sure; but then is ev&shy;ery spirit the “right” spirit? The right and true spirit is the ideal of spirit, the “Holy Spirit.” It is not my or your spirit, but just — an ideal, su&shy;per&shy;nal one, it is “God.” “God is spirit.” And this su&shy;per&shy;nal “Fa&shy;ther in heaven gives it to those that pray to him.”[2]</p>
<p>The man is dis&shy;tin&shy;guished from the youth by the fact that he takes the world as it is, in&shy;stead of ev&shy;ery&shy;where fan&shy;cy&shy;ing it amiss and want&shy;ing to im&shy;prove it, i.e. model it af&shy;ter his ideal; in him the view that one must deal with the world ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to his in&shy;ter&shy;est, not ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to his ide&shy;als, be&shy;comes con&shy;firmed.</p>
<p>So long as one knows him&shy;self only as spirit, and feels that all the value of his ex&shy;is&shy;tence con&shy;sists in be&shy;ing spirit (it be&shy;comes easy for the youth to give his life, the “bod&shy;ily life,” for a noth&shy;ing, for the sil&shy;li&shy;est point of honor), so long it is only thoughts that one has, ideas that he hopes to be able to re&shy;al&shy;ize some day when he has found a sphere of ac&shy;tion; thus one has mean&shy;while only ide&shy;als, un&shy;ex&shy;ecuted ideas or thoughts.</p>
<p>Not till one has fal&shy;len in love with his cor&shy;po&shy;real self, and takes a plea&shy;sure in him&shy;self as a liv&shy;ing flesh-and-blood per&shy;son — but it is in ma&shy;ture years, in the man, that we find it so — not till then has one a per&shy;sonal or ego&shy;is&shy;tic in&shy;ter&shy;est, i.e. an in&shy;ter&shy;est not only of our spirit, e.g., but of to&shy;tal sat&shy;is&shy;fac&shy;tion, sat&shy;is&shy;fac&shy;tion of the whole chap, a self&shy;ish in&shy;ter&shy;est. Just com&shy;pare a man with a youth, and see if he will not ap&shy;pear to you harder, less mag&shy;nan&shy;imous, more self&shy;ish. Is he there&shy;fore worse? No, you say; he has only be&shy;come more def&shy;inite, or, as you also call it, more “prac&shy;ti&shy;cal.” But the main point is this, that he makes him&shy;self more the cen&shy;ter than does the youth, who is in&shy;fat&shy;uated about other things, e.g. God, fa&shy;ther&shy;land, etc.</p>
<p>There&shy;fore the man shows a sec&shy;ond self-dis&shy;cov&shy;ery. The youth found him&shy;self as spirit and lost him&shy;self again in the gen&shy;eral spirit, the com&shy;plete, holy spirit, Man, mankind — in short, all ide&shy;als; the man finds him&shy;self as em&shy;bod&shy;ied spirit.</p>
<p>Boys had only un&shy;in&shy;tel&shy;lec&shy;tual in&shy;ter&shy;ests (i.e. in&shy;ter&shy;ests de&shy;void of thoughts and ideas), youths only in&shy;tel&shy;lec&shy;tual ones; the man has bod&shy;ily, per&shy;sonal, ego&shy;is&shy;tic in&shy;ter&shy;ests.</p>
<p>If the child has not an ob&shy;ject that it can oc&shy;cupy it&shy;self with, it feels en&shy;nui; for it does not yet know how to oc&shy;cupy it&shy;self with it&shy;self. The youth, on the con&shy;trary, throws the ob&shy;ject aside, be&shy;cause for him thoughts arose out of the ob&shy;ject; he oc&shy;cu&shy;pies him&shy;self with his thoughts, his dreams, oc&shy;cu&shy;pies him&shy;self in&shy;tel&shy;lec&shy;tu&shy;ally, or “his mind is oc&shy;cu&shy;pied.”</p>
<p>The young man in&shy;cludes ev&shy;ery&shy;thing not in&shy;tel&shy;lec&shy;tual un&shy;der the con&shy;temp&shy;tu&shy;ous name of “ex&shy;ter&shy;nal&shy;ities.” If he nev&shy;er&shy;the&shy;less sticks to the most triv&shy;ial ex&shy;ter&shy;nal&shy;ities (e.g. the cus&shy;toms of stu&shy;dents’ clubs and other for&shy;mal&shy;ities), it is be&shy;cause, and when, he dis&shy;cov&shy;ers mind in them, i.e. when they are sym&shy;bols to him.</p>
<p>As I find my&shy;self back of things, and that as mind, so I must later find my&shy;self also back of thoughts — to wit, as their cre&shy;ator and owner. In the time of spir&shy;its thoughts grew till they over&shy;topped my head, whose off&shy;spring they yet were; they hov&shy;ered about me and con&shy;vulsed me like fever-phan&shy;tasies — an aw&shy;ful power. The thoughts had be&shy;come cor&shy;po&shy;real on their own ac&shy;count, were ghosts, e.g. God, Em&shy;peror, Pope, Fa&shy;ther&shy;land, etc. If I de&shy;stroy their cor&shy;por&shy;eity, then I take them back into mine, and say: “I alone am cor&shy;po&shy;real.” And now I take the world as what it is to me, as mine, as my prop&shy;erty; I refer all to my&shy;self.</p>
<p>If as spirit I had thrust away the world in the deep&shy;est con&shy;tempt, so as owner I thrust spir&shy;its or ideas away into their “van&shy;ity.” They have no longer any power over me, as no “earthly might” has power over the spirit.</p>
<p>The child was re&shy;al&shy;is&shy;tic, taken up with the things of this world, till lit&shy;tle by lit&shy;tle he suc&shy;ceeded in get&shy;ting at what was back of these very things; the youth was ide&shy;al&shy;is&shy;tic, in&shy;spired by thoughts, till he worked his way up to where he be&shy;came the man, the ego&shy;is&shy;tic man, who deals with things and thoughts ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to his heart’s plea&shy;sure, and sets his per&shy;sonal in&shy;ter&shy;est above ev&shy;ery&shy;thing. Fi&shy;nally, the old man? When I be&shy;come one, there will still be time enough to speak of that.</p>
