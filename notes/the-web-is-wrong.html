<p>The World Wide Web has aban&shy;doned its dreams of being a global de&shy;cen&shy;tral&shy;ized in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion net&shy;work, in favor of ad&shy;ver&shy;tise&shy;ment and pro&shy;pa&shy;ganda. This rev&shy;olu&shy;tionary tech&shy;nology has been stripped of its dig&shy;nity.</p>
<h2 id="Of+Course%2C+It%26rsquo%3Bs+Capitalism">Of Course, It&rsquo;s Capitalism</h2>
<p>The <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> sets the stan&shy;dards for the Web. One look at their <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List">corporate donors</a> tells you ev&shy;ery&shy;thing you need to know.
There are a few well-meaning or&shy;ga&shy;ni&shy;za&shy;tions, like the Wiki&shy;media Foun&shy;da&shy;tion, the Apache Soft&shy;ware Foun&shy;da&shy;tion, the Na&shy;tional Fed&shy;er&shy;ation of the Blind, etc.
Then there&rsquo;s the usual shitty sus&shy;pects: Amazon, Adobe, Net&shy;flix, Amer&shy;ican Ex&shy;press, Dis&shy;cover, Visa, Mas&shy;ter&shy;card, PayPal, Disney, AT&amp;T, Com&shy;cast, Boeing, Face&shy;book, and many more. I don&rsquo;t want these people any&shy;where <em>near</em> Web stan&shy;dards. They seek to mon&shy;etize every as&shy;pect of our lives; the con&shy;cept of &ldquo;free&rdquo; is only useful when it can be used to lure you into ac&shy;tu&shy;ally buying some&shy;thing. </p>
<p>They have <a href="https://www.w3.org/News/2011.html#entry-9234">been accepting such sponsors since 2011</a>, some donating over <em>$100,000 each year</em>. How can you make your voice heard against that kind of money? You can&rsquo;t. </p>
<h2 id="Overstimuation">Overstimuation</h2>
<p>I have been looking into EInk screens. Since they re&shy;flect rather than emit light, they&rsquo;re much easier on the eyes and con&shy;sume very little elec&shy;tricity.</p>
<h2 id="Unintuitive+Paradigms">Unintuitive Paradigms</h2>
<p>We rely on the archetypes cre&shy;ated by pre&shy;vious gen&shy;er&shy;ations of com&shy;puter sci&shy;en&shy;tists and soft&shy;ware de&shy;vel&shy;opers. In hind&shy;sight, maybe some seem&shy;ingly ar&shy;bi&shy;trary de&shy;ci&shy;sions have kept us from a more pleasant ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ence.<sup id="fnref1:indieweb"><a href="#fn:indieweb" class="footnote-ref" aria-label="Jump to Footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>For ex&shy;ample, be&shy;cause the na&shy;ture of a web&shy;page is to ex&shy;tend ver&shy;ti&shy;cally, we end up with a long, con&shy;tin&shy;uous column of text. A more nat&shy;ural paradigm might be a fixed height (the height of your screen), but with hor&shy;izontal scrolling. Not only does this more closely re&shy;semble a book, but it means <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> columns ac&shy;tu&shy;ally have a sen&shy;sible place in our stylesheets. By de&shy;fault, every web browser&rsquo;s stylesheet stretches para&shy;graphs to one or two lines of eye-straining length. </p>
<p>Tim Berners-Lee isn&rsquo;t an ex&shy;pert in ty&shy;pog&shy;raphy, he is a com&shy;puter sci&shy;en&shy;tist; no&shy;body could rea&shy;son&shy;ably ex&shy;pect a beau&shy;ti&shy;fully-typeset Web from the be&shy;gin&shy;ning. That being said, it&rsquo;s been decades since the Web was born, and im&shy;prove&shy;ments on the <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> stan&shy;dards seem fo&shy;cused more on style than sub&shy;stance. We don&rsquo;t need more Javascript frame&shy;works that an&shy;imate and in&shy;finite-scroll; not only are they pro&shy;cessing-in&shy;ten&shy;sive, they gen&shy;er&shy;ally serve to bring more at&shy;ten&shy;tion to ad&shy;ver&shy;tise&shy;ments and other use&shy;less dig&shy;ital junk food. Once we can write a de&shy;cent-looking essay on the Web, per&shy;haps these bits of eye-candy can be re&shy;vis&shy;ited.</p>

<p>There are also a lot of prob&shy;lems in the gen&shy;eral de&shy;sign com&shy;mu&shy;nity when it comes to de&shy;signing for the web.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ev&shy;eryone thinks &ldquo;ty&shy;pog&shy;raphy&rdquo; means enor&shy;mous headers and body copy larger than 14px, while des&shy;ecrating the page with ad&shy;ver&shy;tise&shy;ments and so&shy;cial media wid&shy;gets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> columns can&rsquo;t be au&shy;to&shy;mat&shy;ically broken by page height due to the flex&shy;ible na&shy;ture of the web. Their only real use is in print stylesheets</p>
</li>
</ul>
