<p>The World Wide Web has aban&shy;doned its dreams of be&shy;ing a global de&shy;cen&shy;tral&shy;ized in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion net&shy;work, in fa&shy;vor of ad&shy;ver&shy;tise&shy;ment and pro&shy;pa&shy;ganda. What prob&shy;lems could be solved in or&shy;der for us to make the Web a more pleas&shy;ant place?</p>
<h2 id="Unintuitive+Paradigms">Un&shy;in&shy;tu&shy;itive Paradigms</h2>
<p>We rely on the archetypes cre&shy;ated by pre&shy;vi&shy;ous gen&shy;er&shy;ations of com&shy;puter sci&shy;en&shy;tists and soft&shy;ware de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ers. In hind&shy;sight, maybe some seem&shy;ingly ar&shy;bi&shy;trary de&shy;ci&shy;sions have kept us from a more pleas&shy;ant ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ence.<sup id="fnref1:indieweb"><a href="#fn:indieweb" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>For ex&shy;am&shy;ple, be&shy;cause the na&shy;ture of a web&shy;page is to ex&shy;tend ver&shy;ti&shy;cally, we end up with a long, con&shy;tin&shy;uous column of text. A more nat&shy;ural paradigm might be a fixed height (the height of your screen), but with hor&shy;izon&shy;tal scrolling. Not only does this more closely re&shy;sem&shy;ble a book, but it means <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> columns ac&shy;tu&shy;ally have a sen&shy;si&shy;ble place in our stylesheets. By de&shy;fault, ev&shy;ery web browser&rsquo;s stylesheet stretches para&shy;graphs to one or two lines of eye-strain&shy;ing length. </p>
<p>Tim Bern&shy;ers-Lee isn&rsquo;t an ex&shy;pert in ty&shy;pog&shy;ra&shy;phy, he is a com&shy;puter sci&shy;en&shy;tist; no&shy;body could rea&shy;son&shy;ably ex&shy;pect a beau&shy;ti&shy;fully-type&shy;set Web from the be&shy;gin&shy;ning. That be&shy;ing said, it&rsquo;s been decades since the Web was born, and im&shy;prove&shy;ments on the <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> stan&shy;dards seem fo&shy;cused more on style than sub&shy;stance. We don&rsquo;t need more Javascript frame&shy;works that an&shy;imate and in&shy;finite-scroll; not only are they pro&shy;cess&shy;ing-in&shy;ten&shy;sive, they gen&shy;er&shy;ally serve to bring more at&shy;ten&shy;tion to ad&shy;ver&shy;tise&shy;ments and other use&shy;less dig&shy;ital junk food. Once we can write a de&shy;cent-look&shy;ing es&shy;say on the Web, per&shy;haps these bits of eye-candy can be re&shy;vis&shy;ited.</p>
<h2 id="Understanding+the+Medium">Un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing the Medium</h2>
<p>There are also a lot of prob&shy;lems in the gen&shy;eral de&shy;sign com&shy;mu&shy;nity when it comes to de&shy;sign&shy;ing for the web.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ev&shy;ery&shy;one thinks &ldquo;ty&shy;pog&shy;ra&shy;phy&rdquo; means enor&shy;mous head&shy;ers and body copy larger than 14px, while des&shy;ecrat&shy;ing the page with ad&shy;ver&shy;tise&shy;ments and so&shy;cial me&shy;dia wid&shy;gets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> columns can&rsquo;t be au&shy;to&shy;mat&shy;ically bro&shy;ken by page height due to the flex&shy;ible na&shy;ture of the web. Their only real use is in print stylesheets</p>
</li>
</ul>
