<p>This web&shy;site was de&shy;signed to ad&shy;here to ty&shy;po&shy;graphic best prac&shy;tices. Some of the fea&shy;tures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Foot&shy;note-style ref&shy;er&shy;ences</li>
<li>Qual&shy;ity hy&shy;phen&shy;ation and text jus&shy;ti&shy;fi&shy;ca&shy;tion</li>
<li>Highly leg&shy;ible type&shy;faces at rea&shy;son&shy;able sizes</li>
<li>Proper punc&shy;tu&shy;ation<sup id="fnref1:punctuation"><a href="#fn:punctuation" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>
</li>
<li>Mea&shy;sure is ap&shy;prox&shy;imately 60 char&shy;ac&shy;ters (in&shy;clud&shy;ing spaces)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the best ty&shy;pog&shy;ra&shy;phers who ever lived had no more than one ro&shy;man font at a time, one black&shy;let&shy;ter and one Greek. Oth&shy;ers had as many as five or six ro&shy;mans, two or three ital&shy;ics, three black&shy;let&shy;ters, three or four Greeks. To&shy;day, the ty&shy;pog&shy;ra&shy;pher can buy fonts by the thou&shy;sand over the in&shy;ter&shy;net — more fonts than any hu&shy;man could use, yet never a com&shy;plete se&shy;lec&shy;tion.</p>
<h2 id="Improvements+to+Come">Im&shy;prove&shy;ments to Come</h2>
<p>There are many prob&shy;lems that just can&rsquo;t be fixed yet. Soft hy&shy;phens are pro&shy;gra&shy;mat&shy;ically in&shy;serted in&shy;stead of be&shy;ing gen&shy;er&shy;ated by the browser, re&shy;sult&shy;ing in &ldquo;lad&shy;ders&rdquo;</p>
<p>But that’s by no means all that’s go&shy;ing on here. Dis&shy;pos&shy;ing of Mur&shy;ray Bookchin’s ide&shy;olog&shy;ical and rhetor&shy;ical rub&shy;bish gives Bob the chance to de&shy;velop the grounds for a more gen&shy;eral at&shy;tack on the re&shy;main&shy;ing ves&shy;tiges of left&shy;ism while he’s at it. Clean&shy;ing house of left&shy;ism is a much big&shy;ger task than deal&shy;ing with one man’s left&shy;ist ca&shy;reer. So in one sense, by draw&shy;ing at&shy;ten&shy;tion to his in&shy;ef&shy;fec&shy;tual polemic, Bookchin has made him&shy;self an ex&shy;cuse for the be&shy;gin&shy;ning of a much larger pro&shy;cess of cri&shy;tique, a pro&shy;cess that will un&shy;doubt&shy;edly con&shy;tinue to un&shy;fold with in&shy;creas&shy;ing mil&shy;itance into the com&shy;ing cen&shy;tury. It will re&shy;quire aware&shy;ness and ef&shy;fort from all of us to fin&shy;ish this task, but it will be done.</p>
<p>When I was a very young child, my life was filled with in&shy;tense plea&shy;sure and a vi&shy;tal en&shy;ergy that caused me to feel what I ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;enced to the full. I was the cen&shy;ter of this mar&shy;velous, play&shy;ful ex&shy;is&shy;tence and felt no need to rely on any&shy;thing but my own liv&shy;ing ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ence to ful&shy;fill me.</p>
<h3 id="Breakfast%2C+Lunch+%26+Dinner">Break&shy;fast, Lunch &amp; Din&shy;ner</h3>
<p>I felt in&shy;tensely, I ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;enced in&shy;tensely, my life was a fes&shy;ti&shy;val of pas&shy;sion and plea&shy;sure. My dis&shy;ap&shy;point&shy;ments and sor&shy;rows were also in&shy;tense. I was born a free, wild be&shy;ing in the midst of a so&shy;ci&shy;ety based upon do&shy;mes&shy;ti&shy;ca&shy;tion. There was no way that I could es&shy;cape be&shy;ing do&shy;mes&shy;ti&shy;cated my&shy;self. Civ&shy;iliza&shy;tion will not tol&shy;er&shy;ate what is wild in its midst. But I never for&shy;got the in&shy;ten&shy;sity that life could be. I never for&shy;got the vi&shy;tal en&shy;ergy that had surged through me. My ex&shy;is&shy;tence since I first be&shy;gan to no&shy;tice that this vi&shy;tal&shy;ity was be&shy;ing drained away has been a war&shy;fare be&shy;tween the needs of civ&shy;ilized sur&shy;vival and the need to break loose and ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ence the full in&shy;ten&shy;sity of life un&shy;bound.</p>
<h4 id="Fourth+Heading">Fourth Head&shy;ing</h4>
<p>I want to ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ence this vi&shy;tal en&shy;ergy again. I want to know the free-spirited wild&shy;ness of my un&shy;re&shy;pressed de&shy;sires re&shy;al&shy;iz&shy;ing them&shy;selves in fes&shy;tive play. I want to smash down ev&shy;ery wall that stands be&shy;tween me and the in&shy;tense, pas&shy;sion&shy;ate life of un&shy;tamed free&shy;dom that I want. The sum of these walls is ev&shy;ery&shy;thing we call civ&shy;iliza&shy;tion, ev&shy;ery&shy;thing that comes be&shy;tween us and the di&shy;rect, par&shy;tic&shy;ipa&shy;tory ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ence of the wild world. Around us has grown a web of dom&shy;ina&shy;tion, a web of me&shy;di&shy;ation that lim&shy;its our ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ence, defin&shy;ing the bound&shy;aries of ac&shy;cept&shy;able pro&shy;duc&shy;tion and con&shy;sump&shy;tion.</p>
<h3 id="Third+Heading+Boii">Third Head&shy;ing Boii</h3>
<p>Do&shy;mes&shy;ti&shy;cat&shy;ing au&shy;thor&shy;ity takes many forms, some of which are dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to rec&shy;og&shy;nize. Gov&shy;ern&shy;ment, cap&shy;ital and re&shy;li&shy;gion are some of the more ob&shy;vi&shy;ous faces of au&shy;thor&shy;ity. But tech&shy;nol&shy;ogy, work, lan&shy;guage with its con&shy;cep&shy;tual lim&shy;its, the in&shy;grained habits of eti&shy;quette and pro&shy;pri&shy;ety — these too are do&shy;mes&shy;ti&shy;cat&shy;ing au&shy;thor&shy;ities which trans&shy;form us from wild, play&shy;ful, un&shy;ruly an&shy;imals into tamed, bored, un&shy;happy pro&shy;duc&shy;ers and con&shy;sumers. These things work in us in&shy;sid&shy;iously, lim&shy;it&shy;ing our imag&shy;ina&shy;tions, usurp&shy;ing our de&shy;sires, sup&shy;press&shy;ing our lived ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ence. And it is the world cre&shy;ated by these au&shy;thor&shy;ities, the civ&shy;ilized world, in which we live. If my dream of a life filled with in&shy;tense plea&shy;sure and wild ad&shy;ven&shy;ture is to be re&shy;al&shy;ized, the world must be rad&shy;ically trans&shy;formed, civ&shy;iliza&shy;tion must fall be&shy;fore ex&shy;pand&shy;ing wilder&shy;ness, au&shy;thor&shy;ity must fall be&shy;fore the en&shy;ergy of our wild free&shy;dom. There must be — for want of a bet&shy;ter word — a rev&shy;olu&shy;tion.</p>

<p>But a rev&shy;olu&shy;tion that can break down civ&shy;iliza&shy;tion and re&shy;store the vi&shy;tal en&shy;ergy of un&shy;tamed de&shy;sire can&shy;not be like any rev&shy;olu&shy;tion of the past. All rev&shy;olu&shy;tions to date have cen&shy;tered around power, its use and re&shy;dis&shy;tri&shy;bu&shy;tion. They have not sought to erad&shy;icate the so&shy;cial in&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tions that do&shy;mes&shy;ti&shy;cate; at best they have only sought to erad&shy;icate the power re&shy;la&shy;tion&shy;ships within those in&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tions. So rev&shy;olu&shy;tion&shy;ar&shy;ies of the past have aimed their at&shy;tacks at the cen&shy;ters of power seek&shy;ing to over&shy;throw it. Fo&shy;cused on power, they were blind to the in&shy;sid&shy;ious forces of dom&shy;ina&shy;tion that en&shy;com&shy;pass our daily ex&shy;is&shy;tence and so, when suc&shy;cess&shy;ful at over&shy;throw&shy;ing the pow&shy;ers that be, they ended up re-cre&shy;at&shy;ing them.<sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup> To avoid this, we need to fo&shy;cus not on power, but on our de&shy;sire to go wild, to ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ence life to the full, to know in&shy;tense plea&shy;sure and wild ad&shy;ven&shy;ture. As we at&shy;tempt to re&shy;al&shy;ize this de&shy;sire, we con&shy;front the real forces of dom&shy;ina&shy;tion, the forces that we face ev&shy;ery mo&shy;ment of ev&shy;ery day.<sup id="fnref1:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref">3</a></sup> These forces have no sin&shy;gle cen&shy;ter that can be over&shy;thrown. They are a web that binds us. So rather than try&shy;ing to over&shy;throw the pow&shy;ers that be, we want to un&shy;der&shy;mine dom&shy;ina&shy;tion as we con&shy;front it ev&shy;ery day, help&shy;ing the al&shy;ready col&shy;laps&shy;ing civ&shy;iliza&shy;tion to break down more quickly and as it falls, the cen&shy;ters of power will fall with it. Pre&shy;vi&shy;ous rev&shy;olu&shy;tion&shy;ar&shy;ies have only ex&shy;plored the well-mapped ter&shy;ri&shy;to&shy;ries of power. I want to ex&shy;plore and ad&shy;ven&shy;ture in the un&shy;mapped, and un&shy;map&shy;pable, ter&shy;ri&shy;to&shy;ries of wild free&shy;dom. The rev&shy;olu&shy;tion that can cre&shy;ate the world I want has to be a feral rev&shy;olu&shy;tion.</p>
<h2 id="Heading+Here">Head&shy;ing Here</h2>
<p>There can be no pro&shy;grams or or&shy;ga&shy;ni&shy;za&shy;tions for feral rev&shy;olu&shy;tion, be&shy;cause wild&shy;ness can&shy;not spring from a pro&shy;gram or or&shy;ga&shy;ni&shy;za&shy;tion. Wild&shy;ness springs from the free&shy;ing of our in&shy;stincts and de&shy;sires, from the spon&shy;ta&shy;neous ex&shy;pres&shy;sion of our pas&shy;sions. Each of us has ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;enced the pro&shy;cesses of do&shy;mes&shy;ti&shy;ca&shy;tion, and this ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ence can give us the knowl&shy;edge we need to un&shy;der&shy;mine civ&shy;iliza&shy;tion and trans&shy;form our lives. Our dis&shy;trust of our own ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ence is prob&shy;ably what keeps us from re&shy;belling as freely and ac&shy;tively as we’d like. We’re afraid of fuck&shy;ing up, we’re afraid of our own ig&shy;no&shy;rance. But this dis&shy;trust and fear have been in&shy;stilled in us by au&shy;thor&shy;ity. It keeps us from re&shy;ally grow&shy;ing and learn&shy;ing. It makes us easy tar&shy;gets for any au&shy;thor&shy;ity that is ready to fill us. To set up “rev&shy;olu&shy;tion&shy;ary” pro&shy;grams is to play on this fear and dis&shy;trust, to re&shy;in&shy;force the need to be told what to do. No at&shy;tempt to go feral can be suc&shy;cess&shy;ful when based on such pro&shy;grams. We need to learn to trust and act upon our own feel&shy;ings and ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ences, if we are ever to be free.</p>
