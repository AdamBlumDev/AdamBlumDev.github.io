## Blog Post Heading

It falls to the typography to deal with an increasing herd of flicks, squiggles, dashes, dots and ideographs that travel with the alphabet yet never quite belong. The most essential of these marks &mdash; period, comma, parentheses, and the like &mdash; are signs of logical pause and intonation, much like the rests and slurs in a musical score. Some, like the dollar and per cent signs, are stylized abbreviations. Others, like the asterisk and the dagger, are silent typographical cross-references. And a few that are normally unspoken have tried to sneak their way into the oral tradition. Speakers who say *quote unquote* or *who slash what* or *That&rsquo;s it, period!* are, of course, proving their debt to these enduring para-literary signs.
