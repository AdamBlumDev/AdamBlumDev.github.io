<p>Some of the best ty&shy;pog&shy;ra&shy;phers who ever lived had no more than one roman font at a time, one black&shy;letter and one Greek. Others had as many as five or six ro&shy;mans, two or three italics, three black&shy;let&shy;ters, three or four Greeks. Today, the ty&shy;pog&shy;ra&shy;pher can buy fonts by the thou&shy;sand over the in&shy;ternet --- more fonts than any human could use, yet never a com&shy;plete se&shy;lec&shy;tion.</p>
<p>This is a para&shy;graph. Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's wife.  Their house was su&shy;perduperly small, for the lumber to build it had to be car&shy;ried by wagon many miles.  There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and this room con&shy;tained a rusty looking cook&shy;stove, a cup&shy;board for the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds.<sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" aria-label="Jump to Footnote">1</a></sup>  Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in another corner.  There was no garret at all, and no cellar --- except a small hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family could go in case one<sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" aria-label="Jump to Footnote">2</a></sup> of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to crush any building in its path.  It was reached by a trap door in the middle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark hole.

<p>But that’s by no means all that’s going on here. Dis&shy;posing of Murray Bookchin’s ide&shy;olog&shy;ical and rhetor&shy;ical rub&shy;bish gives Bob the chance to de&shy;velop the grounds for a more gen&shy;eral at&shy;tack on the re&shy;maining ves&shy;tiges of leftism while he’s at it. Cleaning house of leftism is a much bigger task than dealing with one man’s leftist ca&shy;reer. So in one sense, by drawing at&shy;ten&shy;tion to his in&shy;ef&shy;fec&shy;tual polemic, Bookchin has made him&shy;self an ex&shy;cuse for the be&shy;gin&shy;ning of a much larger pro&shy;cess of cri&shy;tique, a pro&shy;cess that will un&shy;doubt&shy;edly con&shy;tinue to un&shy;fold with in&shy;creasing mil&shy;itance into the coming cen&shy;tury. It will re&shy;quire aware&shy;ness and ef&shy;fort from all of us to finish this task, but it will be done.</p>
<p>When I was a very young child, my life was filled with in&shy;tense plea&shy;sure and a vital en&shy;ergy that caused me to feel what I ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;enced to the full. I was the center of this mar&shy;velous, playful ex&shy;is&shy;tence and felt no need to rely on any&shy;thing but my own living ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ence to ful&shy;fill me.</p>
<h3 id="Third+Heading">Third Heading</h3>
<p>I felt in&shy;tensely, I ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;enced in&shy;tensely, my life was a fes&shy;tival of pas&shy;sion and plea&shy;sure. My dis&shy;ap&shy;point&shy;ments and sor&shy;rows were also in&shy;tense. I was born a free, wild being in the midst of a so&shy;ciety based upon do&shy;mes&shy;ti&shy;ca&shy;tion. There was no way that I could es&shy;cape being do&shy;mes&shy;ti&shy;cated my&shy;self. Civ&shy;iliza&shy;tion will not tol&shy;erate what is wild in its midst. But I never forgot the in&shy;ten&shy;sity that life could be. I never forgot the vital en&shy;ergy that had surged through me. My ex&shy;is&shy;tence since I first began to no&shy;tice that this vi&shy;tality was being drained away has been a war&shy;fare be&shy;tween the needs of civ&shy;ilized sur&shy;vival and the need to break loose and ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ence the full in&shy;ten&shy;sity of life un&shy;bound.</p>
<p>I want to ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ence this vital en&shy;ergy again. I want to know the free-spirited wild&shy;ness of my un&shy;re&shy;pressed de&shy;sires re&shy;al&shy;izing them&shy;selves in fes&shy;tive play. I want to smash down every wall that stands be&shy;tween me and the in&shy;tense, pas&shy;sionate life of un&shy;tamed freedom that I want. The sum of these walls is ev&shy;ery&shy;thing we call civ&shy;iliza&shy;tion, ev&shy;ery&shy;thing that comes be&shy;tween us and the di&shy;rect, par&shy;tic&shy;ipa&shy;tory ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ence of the wild world. Around us has grown a web of dom&shy;ina&shy;tion, a web of me&shy;di&shy;ation that limits our ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ence, defining the bound&shy;aries of ac&shy;cept&shy;able pro&shy;duc&shy;tion and con&shy;sump&shy;tion.</p>

<p>Do&shy;mes&shy;ti&shy;cating au&shy;thority takes many forms, some of which are dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to rec&shy;og&shy;nize. Gov&shy;ern&shy;ment, cap&shy;ital and re&shy;li&shy;gion are some of the more ob&shy;vious faces of au&shy;thority. But tech&shy;nology, work, lan&shy;guage with its con&shy;cep&shy;tual limits, the in&shy;grained habits of eti&shy;quette and pro&shy;priety — these too are do&shy;mes&shy;ti&shy;cating au&shy;thor&shy;ities which trans&shy;form us from wild, playful, un&shy;ruly an&shy;imals into tamed, bored, un&shy;happy pro&shy;ducers and con&shy;sumers. These things work in us in&shy;sid&shy;iously, lim&shy;iting our imag&shy;ina&shy;tions, usurping our de&shy;sires, sup&shy;pressing our lived ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ence. And it is the world cre&shy;ated by these au&shy;thor&shy;ities, the civ&shy;ilized world, in which we live. If my dream of a life filled with in&shy;tense plea&shy;sure and wild ad&shy;ven&shy;ture is to be re&shy;al&shy;ized, the world must be rad&shy;ically trans&shy;formed, civ&shy;iliza&shy;tion must fall be&shy;fore ex&shy;panding wilder&shy;ness, au&shy;thority must fall be&shy;fore the en&shy;ergy of our wild freedom. There must be — for want of a better word — a rev&shy;olu&shy;tion.</p>

<p>But a rev&shy;olu&shy;tion that can break down civ&shy;iliza&shy;tion and re&shy;store the vital en&shy;ergy of un&shy;tamed de&shy;sire cannot be like any rev&shy;olu&shy;tion of the past. All rev&shy;olu&shy;tions to date have cen&shy;tered around power, its use and re&shy;dis&shy;tri&shy;bu&shy;tion. They have not sought to erad&shy;icate the so&shy;cial in&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tions that do&shy;mes&shy;ti&shy;cate; at best they have only sought to erad&shy;icate the power re&shy;la&shy;tion&shy;ships within those in&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tions. So rev&shy;olu&shy;tion&shy;aries of the past have aimed their at&shy;tacks at the cen&shy;ters of power seeking to over&shy;throw it. Fo&shy;cused on power, they were blind to the in&shy;sid&shy;ious forces of dom&shy;ina&shy;tion that en&shy;com&shy;pass our daily ex&shy;is&shy;tence and so, when suc&shy;cessful at over&shy;throwing the powers that be, they ended up re-cre&shy;ating them.<sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" aria-label="Jump to Footnote">3</a></sup> To avoid this, we need to focus not on power, but on our de&shy;sire to go wild, to ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ence life to the full, to know in&shy;tense plea&shy;sure and wild ad&shy;ven&shy;ture. As we at&shy;tempt to re&shy;alize this de&shy;sire, we con&shy;front the real forces of dom&shy;ina&shy;tion, the forces that we face every mo&shy;ment of every day.<sup id="fnref1:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" aria-label="Jump to Footnote">4</a></sup> These forces have no single center that can be over&shy;thrown. They are a web that binds us. So rather than trying to over&shy;throw the powers that be, we want to un&shy;der&shy;mine dom&shy;ina&shy;tion as we con&shy;front it every day, helping the al&shy;ready col&shy;lapsing civ&shy;iliza&shy;tion to break down more quickly and as it falls, the cen&shy;ters of power will fall with it. Pre&shy;vious rev&shy;olu&shy;tion&shy;aries have only ex&shy;plored the well-mapped ter&shy;ri&shy;to&shy;ries of power. I want to ex&shy;plore and ad&shy;ven&shy;ture in the un&shy;mapped, and un&shy;map&shy;pable, ter&shy;ri&shy;to&shy;ries of wild freedom. The rev&shy;olu&shy;tion that can create the world I want has to be a feral rev&shy;olu&shy;tion.</p>
<h2 id="Heading+Here">Heading Here</h2>
<p>There can be no pro&shy;grams or or&shy;ga&shy;ni&shy;za&shy;tions for feral rev&shy;olu&shy;tion, be&shy;cause wild&shy;ness cannot spring from a pro&shy;gram or or&shy;ga&shy;ni&shy;za&shy;tion. Wild&shy;ness springs from the freeing of our in&shy;stincts and de&shy;sires, from the spon&shy;ta&shy;neous ex&shy;pres&shy;sion of our pas&shy;sions. Each of us has ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;enced the pro&shy;cesses of do&shy;mes&shy;ti&shy;ca&shy;tion, and this ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ence can give us the knowl&shy;edge we need to un&shy;der&shy;mine civ&shy;iliza&shy;tion and trans&shy;form our lives. Our dis&shy;trust of our own ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ence is prob&shy;ably what keeps us from re&shy;belling as freely and ac&shy;tively as we’d like. We’re afraid of fucking up, we’re afraid of our own ig&shy;no&shy;rance. But this dis&shy;trust and fear have been in&shy;stilled in us by au&shy;thority. It keeps us from re&shy;ally growing and learning. It makes us easy tar&shy;gets for any au&shy;thority that is ready to fill us. To set up “rev&shy;olu&shy;tionary” pro&shy;grams is to play on this fear and dis&shy;trust, to re&shy;in&shy;force the need to be told what to do. No at&shy;tempt to go feral can be suc&shy;cessful when based on such pro&shy;grams. We need to learn to trust and act upon our own feel&shy;ings and ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ences, if we are ever to be free.</p>
